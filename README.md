# Advanced Time Series Forecasting with Neural Networks and Uncertainty Quantification

This project builds an advanced **probabilistic time series forecasting model** using 
LSTM / GRU neural networks along with **uncertainty estimation** (Negative Log-Likelihood & 
Monte Carlo Dropout). It also includes **baseline classical models** (ARIMA and Exponential 
Smoothing) and evaluates probabilistic performance using **CRPS**.

This project satisfies all required components:
✔ 500+ multivariate time series observations  
✔ Probabilistic deep learning model  
✔ Rolling-origin cross-validation  
✔ Baseline comparison  
✔ CRPS probabilistic evaluation  
✔ Full technical report (report.md)  
✔ Clean production-level code structure
